Quick exit button annotation tool
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
See INSTALL for installation instructions.

To launch the tool, run `evaluate.py`. The console will print an overview of how to use the tool, and then launch a
Chrome browser for annotations. On first time setup, you will be asked to input your name into the console; after this,
you do not need to check the Python window.

The annotation cycle is speedtests -> survey -> speedtests. The first round of speedtests are testing the learnability
of the various components: how long does it take to identify where/what they are and use them. The survey then asks a
series of questions about the usability of the different components (and the site will be open in another tab for you
to look back at). The second round of speedtests evaluates the memorability of the components: can you remember how to
use them after doing something else (if you don't remember, try to find them anew).

After the memorability tests, the browser will show a blank page and a pop-up alert; the results for the last site are
now saved, and you are free to take a break. The next site will load when you close the alert.

Results (and your name) are saved to evaluation.json after each site. The tool will load your progress from this file
when launched, and I will need you to send a copy of the json file when you are finished annotating.

Please let me know of any bugs or problems you encounter, and I will try to fix them asap!
